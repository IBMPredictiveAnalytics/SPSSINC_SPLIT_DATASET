<pre class="example"><code>spssinc split dataset splitvar= educ

/options names=values filelist=&quot;c:/temp/target/files.txt&quot; printlist=yes.
</code></pre>

<p>This command partitions the cases in the active dataset into a collection of 
data files with all the cases for each value of the split variable(s) in a different file.
In combination withe SPSSINC PROCESS FILES it generalizes the standard SPLIT FILES capability by
allowing you to execute arbitrary blocks of syntax for each distinct split value.
Data do not need to be sorted by the split variable for this command.</p>

<p>The output file name is by default constructed from the variable values or labels
with an underscore between parts if multiple variables are used.</p>

<p><strong>FILENAME</strong> can be used to override these names.  It can be a pattern such as
described below for directories.  It is always given a <em>sav</em> extension.
System-missing values are written to a dataset named $Sysmis.sav.
A blank string value will be written to a dataset named .sav  (no rootname).
Such names are legal, but on some operating systems a directory listing will not show
names starting with a period by default.</p>

<p><strong>SPLITVAR</strong> names one or more string or numeric variables that define the splits.<br/>
If numeric, the values must be integers.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>DIRECTORY</strong> optionally names a directory for the output.  If not specified, the current
working directory for the SPSS Processor is used.  The specified directory will be created
if it does not already exist.</p>

<p>The directory can be a simple path such as <code>&quot;c:\project\splits&quot;</code> or it can refer to some or
all of the variables used in splitting.  To refer to a variable value, use the variable name
in the path like this <code>&quot;${varname}&quot;</code>.  For example, if splitting by variables xvar and yvar,
you could write</p>

<pre><code>DIRECTORY = &quot;c:/mydata/abc${xvar}/${yvar}&quot;.  
</code></pre>

<p>If xvar has values &ldquo;xyz&rdquo; and &ldquo;KLM&rdquo; and
yvar has values 1 and 2, then directories<br/>
c:/mydata/abcxyz/1,<br/>
c:/mydata/abcxyz/2,<br/>
c:/mydata/abcKLM/1, and<br/>
c:/mydata/abcKLM/2<br/>
could be created and used.  Only value combinations actually occurring in the data will
be created. </p>

<p>On a case-insensitive file system such as used by Windows,
the files created could be different from other systems.<br/>
Characters typically not allowed in directory names are replaced with underscores (_).
These are  &ldquo; * ? &lt; &gt; |</p>

<p>If <strong>MAKETEMPDIR</strong> is specified, a new temporary directory is created and used for the
output.  DIRECTORY must not be specified if this option is used.</p>

<p><strong>DELETECONTENTS</strong> specifies whether all  SPSS sav files are removed before new files are
written.  Use with caution!  It cannot be used if DIRECTORY is not specified.  If the directory specification
includes variable substitutions, only directory references for values in the dataset being split
will be cleared.</p>

<p><strong>NAMES</strong> can specify VALUES, the default, or LABELS or NUMBERS.  It determines how
the output directories and files are named.  For VALUES the file names are like value.sav, 
for LABELS, the file names are like label.sav; for numbers, the file names are sequential numbers.
If NAMES=NUMBERS and there is a directory pattern, the variable values are used
to expand that pattern.  The NAMES setting determines whether values or labels are
displayed in the detailed output pivot table.</p>

<p>Characters in the values or labels that would be illegal in a file name, including those listed
above and / or \, are replaced by the underscore character.
If using LABELS, the value is used if there is no label.</p>

<p>By default, the same NAMES choice is used for file names.  You can override this by
specifying <strong>FILENAMESUBS</strong> = VALUES or LABELS.</p>

<p>If <strong>NAMEPREFIX</strong> is specified, that text plus _ will be prefixed to the output file names.
NAMEPREFIX cannot be combined with FILENAME.</p>

<p>If specified, <strong>FILELIST</strong> names a file that will contain a list of all the files that were written
along with the associated values.  This file can be used as input to SPSSINC PROCESS FILES.
If file handles are in use, the paths in the log are expanded to the true names if using V18
or later, but Viewer output is left in terms of the handles</p>
